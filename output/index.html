<h1>How to use DocuGen</h1>
<p>To use docugen create all of your md files and folders, once created go to <code>config.json</code> and configure it. <br />
When everything is configured run <code>node .</code> and the compiler will create an HTML version in your output directory (You don't need to create a folder)</p>
